# Frequently asked questions

## How do I get the key to the Riverwood Bridge House?

Septimus removed the Tomb of Sacropha from the mod beause its layout was confusing to first-time players. You can purchase a key to the house from Lucen in Riverwood Traders.

## How come the fire spell doesn't open Myrwatch?

Septimus includes a balance mod that requires you to have 350 mana before the spell to open Myrwatch will work.

## Can I respec?

Yes, use the Draught of the Fate Unwound potion from [Ish's Respec Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1960).

## Why does Septimus 3 include SimonRim instead of EnaiRim?

Guitarninja likes the balanced and cohesive gameplay offered by the full [SimonRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files) suite. We think you will enjoy the experience too.

## Why doesn't Septimus 3 include a follower framework?

Many followers, like Inigo and Lucien, include their own custom follower frameworks and break when imported into a third party follower framework. You can get at least 8 followers and pets simultaneously in Septimus without a follower framework, so including one is overkill. Septimus did include NFF for a while but it seemed to contribute to stability issues. The Septimus team constantly evaluates new mods and if they find a follower framework that works and appears stable, this decision may be revisited.

## How can I carry around all my stuff without a follower framework?

Vigilant and Meeko can both be given dog backpacks and are great for carrying stuff. The [LotD Rains' Shelter](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Rains'_Shelter) is a portable tent that can be pitched anywhere (including inside buildings and dungeons) and which provides unlimited access to the LotD Safehouse linked storage. The [LotD Stash Supplies](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Stash_Supplies) spell also provides access to the LotD Safehouse linked storage. With the LotD backpack, bandoliers, and LotD perks, you can easily get your carry weight up to 800+. The LotD Relic Storage container from the [LotD Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529) provides infinite relic storage accessible from anywhere. 

## Why can't I craft bags/backpacks/cloaks/clothes?

In order to craft them, you must take at least the first rank of Tailor perk in the Smithing tree. 

## What is this "Restore Warmth" in the Alchemy Station, and why is nothing under it?

This is the side effect of our changes to Resist Frost in order to for player crafted Resist Cold potions to resist cold weather/water. Just ignore it.

## Why doesn't Septimus include all the all the Alternate Start options?

Septimus is a curated list and removes some options due to balance or stability issues. For example, Septimus does not include the Bruma start because Bruma is balanced for slightly later game characters.
