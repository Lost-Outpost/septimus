# Help

For issues that aren't documented, you can provide details in the [Issues](https://github.com/Guitarninja2/septimus/issues) page. Please provide as much info as you can (screenshots are great).

Finally, free feel to hop on the Septimus Discord support channel to have discussions with our knowledgeable community members. Support is offered in [The Animonculory Server](https://discord.gg/DffHKcszfg).

# Frequently asked questions

## When should I ping Guitarninja on [The Animonculory Server](https://discord.gg/DffHKcszfg)?

Only if you find a quality among us meme. Any other situation is not acceptable.

## How do I get the key to the Riverwood Bridge House?

Septimus removed the Tomb of Sacropha from the mod beause its layout was confusing to first-time players. You can purchase a key to the house from Lucen in Riverwood Traders.

## How come the fire spell doesn't open Myrwatch?

Septimus includes a balance mod that requires you to have 350 mana before the spell to open Myrwatch will work.

## Can I respec?

Yes, use the Draught of the Fate Unwound potion from [Ish's Respec Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1960).

## Why does Septimus 3 include SimonRim instead of EnaiRim?

Guitarninja likes the balanced and cohesive gameplay offered by the full [SimonRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files) suite. We think you will enjoy the experience too.

## How can I carry around all my stuff?

Vigilant and Meeko can both be given dog backpacks and are great for carrying stuff. The [LotD Rains' Shelter](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Rains'_Shelter) is a portable tent that can be pitched anywhere (including inside buildings and dungeons) and which provides unlimited access to the LotD Safehouse linked storage.

The [LotD Stash Supplies](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Stash_Supplies) spell also provides access to the LotD Safehouse linked storage. With the LotD backpack, bandoliers, and LotD perks, you can easily get your carry weight up to 800+. The LotD Relic Storage container from the [LotD Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529) provides infinite relic storage accessible from anywhere. 

## Why can't I craft bags/backpacks/cloaks/clothes?

In order to craft them, you must take at least the first rank of Tailor perk in the Smithing tree. 

## What is this "Restore Warmth" in the Alchemy Station, and why is nothing under it?

This is the side effect of our changes to Resist Frost in order to for player crafted Resist Cold potions to resist cold weather/water. Just ignore it.

## Why doesn't Septimus include all the all the Alternate Start options?

Septimus is a curated list and removes some options due to balance or stability issues. For example, Septimus does not include the Bruma start because Bruma is balanced for slightly later game characters.

## Why isn't X mod included?

There are as many reasons a mod wouldn't be included in a list as there are stars in the sky. Here's some of the most common ones. Pick whichever one is applicable, or your favorite.

1. The list author didn't know that mod existed.
2. It's incompatible with other mods in the list.
3. It's nonfunctional.
4. It has problems such as causing CTDs, infinite loading screens, or more.
5. It doesn't fit the list in question.
6. Something in the list already does what that mod does.
7. The list author doesn't like the mod.
8. It would require too much work to add for not enough benefit.

If you're asking this question as a roundabout way of suggesting a mod, don't.

## Will a save from version X be safe with version Y?

All modlists in the Animonculory use semantic versioning which translates to the following:

- 2.0.x are save game safe

- 2.x.x may require a new save game

- x.0.0 definitely requires a new save game

## Will saves from one beta version be safe with another beta version or the full release?

Very unlikely. Do not ask if beta saves will be save safe.

The purpose behind beta versions is for play testing to help Guitarninja and the team find and squash bugs before a major release, and squashing bugs often includes removing misbehaving mods which in turn breaks saves.

The Septimus team would like to thank everyone who plays beta versions and reports issues with the understanding that their saves will not be safe. You are making the modlist better for our entire community.

## Why is the Septimus icon an amogus?

Don't ask, [it's complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70DZ5UV1Bdo).

## Why can't I start building in Blackthorn?

If you read the letter on top of the workbench, it is addressed to the Thane of Riften. It requires you to complete the quest [I Done Got Thaned!](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/I_Done_Got_Thaned!). Before you can craft anything, you first must craft Blackthorn Manor.  It is the only thing you can build at that workbench. All further building of shops/walls/etc can only be done at workbench on the first floor of Blackthorn Manor. You are effectively the landlord of Blackthorn, and make all major decisions from the Manor.

## Where are the Profit Chests in the Blackthorn shops?

They have been removed. It doesn't make sense for you to be stealing from their cash registers. You can collect rent from the residents of Blackthorn within Blackthorn Manor. 

## What can I do if I get stuck after reading a book or using the Dwemer compass?

First, this sometimes happens when you read a book or use the Dwemer compass shortly after entering a new cell. If you wait a few seconds after entering a cell, it should not happen. If you do get stuck, try pressing <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>R</kbd>. If that doesn't work, you can use the console <code>coc</code> command to get unstuck, such as <kbd>~</kbd> to open the console, then issuing the command <code>coc riverwood</code>.

## Why can't I use a Fate Card Pack?

First, this sometimes happens when you have multiple fate card packs in your inventory. Simply drop all the packs except one, then use <kbd>E</kbd> on the one pack in your inventory, and pick up and use each fate card pack one at a time.

## Why is the hidden switch behind the throne in the Guild Master alternate start not appearing?

You have to go down the stairs and stand next to the locked door for a moment before the hidden switch will appear. Also, as an aside, do not accept the ride back to Whiterun in this start. Doing so will cause a bug that permanently saddles you with the expedition horse, for which you can neither dismiss or access inventory.
